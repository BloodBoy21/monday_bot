## Supabase configuration üóÑÔ∏è

1. Create a new Supabase project.
2. Create a new table called issues.
3. Add the following columns to the issues table:

    - issue_id: varchar
    - board: varchar
    - group: varchar
    - title: text
    - status: text
    - assigned_to: text
    - client: text
    - group_id: varchar
4. Create a new table called servers.
5. Add the following columns to the servers table:
    - id: integer, primary key, auto increment
    - created_at: timestamp
    - server_id: varchar
    - group_id: varchar
    - board_id: varchar
    - name: text
    - status_list: json

## Additional Information üìñ
This bot uses the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io) library to interact with the Discord API and use python 3.9. It also uses the [monday API](https://monday.com/developers/v2) to get issues from monday.com.

You can edit the `issue class` in the monday.py file to add more fields to the issues table and the `__create_issue` method in the monday.py file to save your required fields in the database.

```python
class Issue:
    def __init__(self, data, title=None):
        self.title = title or data.get("name", "Sin t√≠tulo")
        self.client = data.get("client", "Sin cliente")
        self.assigned_to = data.get("asignado a", "Sin asignar")
        self.status = data.get("estado", "Sin estado")
        self.type = data.get("tipo", "Sin tipo")
        self.date = data.get("creation log", "Sin fecha")
        self.group = data.get("group", "Sin grupo")
        self.platform = data.get("plataforma", "Sin plataforma")
        self.resolution = data.get("fecha de resoluci√≥n", "Sin resolver")
        self.id = data.get("id", "Sin id")
        self.board_id = data["board"]
        self.group_id = data["group_id"]
        self.__save_in_db()
        self.url = f"https://{MONDAY_HOST}/boards/{self.board_id}/pulses/{self.id}"
```
